<a id='prerequisites'></a>
## Prerequisites
1. Linux(Ubuntu) with GPU enabled.
2. [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ee/ubuntu) installed.
4. [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com).

The tutorial was developed on an [Azure Ubuntu
DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro),
which addresses the first three prerequisites.

## Setup
To set up your environment to run these notebooks, please follow these steps.  They setup the notebooks to use Docker and Azure seamlessly.
1. Create a _Linux_ DSVM (NC6 or above to use GPU).
2. Clone, fork, or download the zip file for this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/AKSDeploymentTutorialAML.git
   ```
3. Add your user to the docker group (after executing this command, exit and start a new bash shell): 
   ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
   To verify whether you have correct configuration, try executing `docker ps` command. You should not get `permission denied` errors.

4. Navigate to _./AKSDeploymentTutorial\_AML/Keras\_Tensorflow_ directory

5. Create the Python virtual environment using the environment.yml:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
6. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source activate aks_deployment_aml
   ```
7. Login to Azure:
   ```
   az login
   ```
8. If you have more than one Azure subscription, select it:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <Your Azure Subscription>
   ```
9. Start the Jupyter notebook server in the virtual environment:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
10. Select correct kernel: set the kernel to be `Python [conda env: aks_deployment_aml]`(or `Python 3` if that option does not show).

## Steps
After following the setup instructions above, run the Jupyter notebooks in order starting with the first notebook [00_AMLSetup.ipynb](./00_AMLSetup.ipynb).

<a id='cleanup'></a>
## Cleaning up
To remove the conda environment created see [here](https://conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/commands/remove.html). The [last Jupyter notebook](./07_TearDown.ipynb)  also gives details on deleting Azure resources associated with this repository.
